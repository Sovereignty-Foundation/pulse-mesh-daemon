# The publish gate. It needs no `just`, and runs on macOS's bash 3.2 and
# on Linux.
#
#   scripts/gate.sh           what a change passes before it merges
#   scripts/gate.sh --quick   the per-commit subset
#   scripts/gate.sh --full    the gate, plus the bindings, the fuzz build,
#                             the thin clients and the Linux and x86 legs
#   ... --skip <check>[,<check>...]
#                             the same, less the checks named, where they
#                             do not apply (see CI below)
#
# Every check runs, whatever the others did, and is judged by its exit
# status alone. Its output goes to target/gate/<check>.log. The gate prints
# one line per check with its time, a failed line ending with the last line
# of its log, then a summary, and exits 1 if any check failed. A check
# whose tool is missing fails and names the command that installs it;
# nothing is skipped but what --skip names. The gate refuses a --skip name
# that is not a check of its mode, and its first and last lines name the
# checks it left out. A check the tree leaves out (below) may be named in
# --skip, so one --skip list serves the integrated tree and every
# repository cut from it. A check over a surface the tree does not hold (the
# fuzz harness, the bindings, the thin clients, the daemon, the basket
# query tool, the comparator harnesses: each in the integrated tree, some
# in a repository cut from it) is left out too, and the first line names
# it.
#
# CI: the workflows run this script rather than restate its checks: in
# the integrated tree .gitea/workflows/ci.yml (and ci-compat.yml, the gate
# on macOS), and in each repository cut from it .github/workflows/ci.yml.
# Each runs the gate on a pull request, and on a push the full gate with
# --skip linux-test-1g,linux-test-64m,linux-net,linux-clippy: those four
# bring Linux to a Mac, in Docker, and a Linux runner needs none but
# linux-net, its test and clippy-all-features checks running on Linux
# already, with the /dev/shm the runner has; linux-net needs a privileged
# container, which the runner does not give.
#
# The gate runs in a git checkout or in a tree without .git, such as an
# export, where every check runs as in a checkout but license: the license
# gate reads the tracked files with git ls-files, so without .git that
# check fails, saying it needs a checkout. The versions check walks the
# tree where git cannot list its files, and in a checkout checks that the
# walk finds the files git lists.
#
# The gate:
#   fmt                  cargo fmt --check, in the workspace and in the
#                        fuzz harness, which is a workspace of its own
#   license              scripts/license-gate.sh, also the pre-push hook
#   versions             scripts/check-versions.py: every version string
#                        in the tree is the workspace's, and every
#                        rust-version agrees with the toolchain
#                        rust-toolchain.toml pins
#   arch-check           scripts/arch-check.py: the tier, import-point,
#                        consumer, module-table, non_exhaustive and pin
#                        rules, then the check's own self-test
#   clippy               clippy -D warnings on every target
#   clippy-all-features  the same with every feature on
#   check-all-features   cargo check with every feature and no test
#                        targets, so that a feature only a dev-dependency
#                        turns on cannot hide a broken build
#   hub-no-default       mesh-hub without its default features
#   rustdoc              cargo doc with warnings and broken or private
#                        intra-doc links denied
#   test                 the workspace tests, in the debug profile, so
#                        overflow checks and debug assertions run
#   multicast            pulse-wire-udp's multicast delivery tests, which
#                        a plain cargo test ignores: on a host that cannot
#                        deliver multicast they print SKIP: and check
#                        nothing, so this check fails on a SKIP: line and is
#                        green only when frames were delivered (on macOS a
#                        process without Local Network access cannot send;
#                        the loopback path usually still delivers)
#   canon-serde          pulse-canon's tests with its serde feature on;
#                        nothing in the workspace turns the feature on, so
#                        the test check alone never runs them
#   hub-otel             mesh-hub's tests with its otel feature on, the
#                        OpenTelemetry export the test check never builds
#   pms-query            tools/pms-query's tests, on basket files made
#                        with the schema mesh-basket gives the daemon's
#                        (they read it from the crate); here and not only
#                        in --full, as they take a tenth of a second, need
#                        only python3, and fail when a change to the
#                        crate's schema breaks the tool
#   deny                 cargo deny: advisories, bans and sources, with
#                        every feature on
#   docs                 scripts/docs/check.sh: the book's checks, mdbook
#                        build and the tutorials' smoke run
#
# --quick runs fmt, license, versions, arch-check, clippy and docs-structure
# (the book's version, SUMMARY, link and term checks). Each takes seconds,
# clippy re-checks only what changed, and together they catch what a commit most
# often breaks. The rest build a second configuration or release binaries,
# run the suites or need the network, and are left to the gate.

#                        each linted with clippy -D warnings, every
