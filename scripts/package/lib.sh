# The Linux artifacts are built and smoke-tested in Docker. colima and

# the tree is copied (rsync, leaving out what .gitignore lists) to a cache
# under the home directory, $HOME/.cache/pulse-mesh-package
# (PACKAGE_CACHE moves it):
#   registry/            the cargo registry, shared by every container
#   <key>/<job>/src      the copy of the tree one script's containers use
#   <key>/<job>/...      that script's target directories and output
# <key> is the tree's directory name and a checksum of its path, so each
# worktree has its own; <job> is wheels, node or smoke, so the three
# scripts can run at once. Two runs of one script on one tree cannot.
