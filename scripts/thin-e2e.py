"""The two thin clients against a real daemon.

    scripts/thin-e2e.py <mesh-hub binary>

Starts the daemon on endpoints of its own: a socket in a new temporary
directory, a WebSocket port the kernel picks (the daemon logs it) and the
hub name e2e-<pid>, within the 15 characters a hub name may have. The
Python thin client attaches and subscribes to one channel; the Node thin
client (scripts/thin-e2e.js, run by node) attaches, subscribes to another
and sends three envelopes on the first; once the Node client has
subscribed, the Python client sends three on the second. Each side checks
what it received against what the other sent: the payload bytes (binary,
so base64 must carry every byte value), the channel, the type name, the
sender's name in the origin, and the envelope identifier the sender's send
returned. Then both detach, and the daemon must exit 0 on SIGTERM and
remove its socket. Exits 1 naming what went wrong, with the end of the
daemon's log.

Needs websocket-client for python3 and ws installed in the thin Node
client (the gate's thin-e2e check says how to install either). The
suites under the clients' own directories stub the transport; this is
the one run of either against a daemon.
