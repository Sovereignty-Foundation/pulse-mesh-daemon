#   scripts/fuzz.sh                      every target, 60 seconds each
#   scripts/fuzz.sh <target> [seconds]   one target
#   scripts/fuzz.sh all <seconds>        every target, that long each
#
# The targets are the [[bin]] entries of fuzz/Cargo.toml, as
# `cargo fuzz list` reads them, run one after another. Sixty seconds is
# the default: on an arm64 Mac it gives a target from about 150 thousand
# executions (fuzz_fec_decoder, the slowest) to 30 million
# (fuzz_wire_decode), enough to get past the shallow paths a change
# breaks first, and a sweep of every target stays near a quarter of an
# hour, short enough to run before a review. A search for deeper bugs
# gives one target hours. Each target's corpus grows in
# fuzz/corpus/<target>, where the next run starts, and each
# run's output goes to target/fuzz/<target>.log.
#
# The first target that fails stops the run: the script prints the end of
# its log, names the input libFuzzer saved in
# fuzz/artifacts/<target>/ (a crash, a timeout or a memory
# blow-up) with the command that replays it, and exits 1. Needs the
# nightly toolchain and cargo-fuzz.
